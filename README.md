# Women-mood-swings

This repository contains an exploratory analysis of factors influencing mood swings in women, leveraging a comprehensive dataset and visualizations to uncover patterns and insights.
Overview
The project focuses on analyzing various personal, environmental, and lifestyle factors that may contribute to mood swings in women. The analysis is conducted using Python in a Jupyter Notebook (women-mood.ipynb), with data sourced from the women_mood_swings_dataset.csv file.

**Dataset Description**

The dataset includes 5000 entries, each representing a unique participant. Key variables include:

_Demographics: _Age, relationship role (wife/girlfriend), and relationship duration.

_Mood Indicators:_ Mood level (1-10), menstrual phase, PMS symptoms.

_Social and Relationship Factors:_ Partner support level, conflict intensity, social interaction level.

_Health Factors:_ Mental health status, health conditions (e.g., PCOS, thyroid issues), use of therapy.

**Analysis Highlights**

The analysis explores correlations between mood levels and various factors such as:
Menstrual phases and PMS symptoms.
Sleep quality and stress levels.
Social interactions and partner support.
Environmental conditions like weather and temperature.
Visualizations include histograms, scatter plots, and heat maps to illustrate trends and relationships.
